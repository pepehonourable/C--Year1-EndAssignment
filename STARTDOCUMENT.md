##Problem description

A company provides catering services. The administration for a number of
customers is processed for a period indicated by a start and end date.
A customer can take a starter (3 euros) and/or a main course (5 euros) and/or a
dessert (2 euros) each day.
A program must be developed in which the customer's name and the number
of starters, number of main courses and number of desserts he/she had are
registered. The company ultimately wants to be presented with the following
information:
> The total amount of turnover;
> The average daily turnover;
> The name of the customer who has made purchases for the highest
amount;
> The name of the customers who have had starters but have never had
a dessert;
> The names of the customers who have made purchases for a higher
amount than the average per customer.
